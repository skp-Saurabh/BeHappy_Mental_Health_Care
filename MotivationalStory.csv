I had recently lost my best friend, one of the most trusted people of my life. I was in need of a support. Everything was new to me. And eventually, I made a huge blunder in choosing friends, probably the biggest mistake of my life. They misused my innocence and love what I had for them as persons and exposed me to addictions. Thankfully I wasn't taken into it. One of them became a very close friend of mine just to come close to and eventually propose a girl who was my close friend. Again I was used. All of this distraction led my grades to detoriate. And all of a sudden I lost my maternal grandma, who was my very first inspiration. These heartbreaks and trust issues led me into Depression until a guy came to my rescue. He pushed me forward in every way he could. And helped me secure 92% in IX. But I didn't recover completely. I wasn't emotionally stable at all. Then another guy joined the school and unknowingly became very close. I was inspired by him. I saw a different perception of life. His personality was very like my grandma's. And without the knowledge of both me and himself, he made me emotionally strong and taught me self worth and confidence, which I lacked during that phase. These two guys played a huge role in my recovery and because of them I'm alive. There were times when I thought of jumping off the terrace of our 8 storeyed building, cutting my veins,etc. But Everytime I was stopped by the visuals of my mom, my grandma, and them. The second guy insisted me to continue with my sports and music, which I had almost left during the phase ( I'm a state level Badminton player and swimmer and I'm classically trained in vocal and sitar). Yes indeed. Coming back into sports helped me a lot recovering. The key point to fight depression is to accept. Confidence automatically vanishes. But acceptance makes the task easier to get it back and right."
MotivationalStory,Aishwarya,There are some negatives and positives of everything that happens in life and we just need to find our light at the end of the tunnel.,"TUG OF WAR ""Why are you being so moody?"" ""Why are you so quiet?"" ""Suddenly you seem more cheerful than usual."" ""Why are you such a cry baby?"" ""People like you should be put in a mental institution.""","TUG OF WAR ""Why are you being so moody?"" ""Why are you so quiet?"" ""Suddenly you seem more cheerful than usual."" ""Why are you such a cry baby?"" ""People like you should be put in a mental institution."" Wondering who would say such hurtful things to another person? Well, ""abnormal"" people have to hear these questions and statements on a daily basis from people who are ""normal"". Mental illness is like a road trip that you never decided to take, and you are forced to drive without a GPS. Getting diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder was the beginning of one such road trip for me which started in 2016. I had always been a troubled child and found myself in a therapist's cabin quite often. In one such visit to the therapist, after responding to a number of questionnaires, I was told that I have a mental illness, BD 2, and if I don't start medication soon, my condition might degrade. I've been struggling with various emotional, physical, and social issues that come as a part and parcel of being mentally ill. People comment on my weight. My parents frequently worry that I might kill myself, who will marry me, will I have a normal life, how will people treat me when they come to know about my illness, etc. My close friends check on me regularly to see if I've taken my medicines or not. People who know about me having Bipolar say to me that I seem to be pretty normal. But well mental illness is not a physical wound that that can be seen externally. Have I recovered completely? No. But I have learned to manage my life and accepted Bipolar to be a part of it. Acceptance is the most difficult part of having a mental illness. It took me months to accept that I have a mental illness that cannot be cured. I started doubting myself, that how will I be a good psychologist when I am mentally ill myself. I even considered giving up on psychology because it felt like the subject failed me, studying it didn't even help me take care of my own mind. I found it difficult to understand whether I'm doing something as a result of me being ""crazy"", or because I really want to do that thing. There was a constant thrust I faced at every step in my life. There was anxiety about how people will treat me. There was fear because of the side effects of the medication. I was losing confidence as fast as I was gaining weight. I didn't love or accept myself anymore. I couldn't concentrate on classes because I used to be sleepy all the time. I was living away from my parents in a hostel, and loneliness was another issue that I had to deal with. It isn't as bad as it sounds. I am grateful that I have Bipolar. It helps me get a better insight into the lives of others who have mental illnesses, which in turn helps me help them. After four years, I'm stable, but there do come moments when the symptoms of my illness interfere with other aspects of my life. Regular consultation and sessions with my psychiatrist and psychologist help me stay stable and deal with relapse. Also, I have a very strong support system in the form of my parents, my best friend, and my dogs. I am grateful for them being a part of my life. I started working on spreading mental health awareness with my best friend, which acts as another anchor and gives me peace and stability. There are some negatives and positives of everything that happens in life, we just need to find our light at the end of the tunnel. I dedicate this article to all those who had to take up this road trip. May you find your GPS soon.ddenly you seem more cheerful than usual."" ""Why are you such a cry baby?""

MotivationalStory,Pornima,Growing up and giving my life a meaningful turn is what I learned from my tryst with depression.,Being a daughter of a School van driver; I grew up in Mumbai chawl in a traditional middle-class family. I was told to choose an educational path because it gives the financial stability in our Indian culture.,"Being a daughter of a School van driver; I grew up in Mumbai chawl in a traditional middle-class family. I was told to choose an educational path because it gives the financial stability in our Indian culture. When I was 12th Std, I didn't get enough career guidance. When my board result got declared, there were inquiries about my careers from home. Initially, I was not studying for CET (Medical/ Engineering entrance) at all; because all I wanted to score good in 12th exam. Because of it I fell short & scored less in the CET exam which I had given only for the namesake. I did not get admission for Med. / Engg. in any college on these marks. In this situation I dropped a year and I became clueless to the questions of my career that fell on me. Many of my classmates who got 50% marks were also studying in some or the other college. Having been at home for almost a year I went into depression, I had to hear from my relatives that a year has been wasted, then how will it happen next, will the wedding of a girl take place on time, etc. Meanwhile I met a friend who was doing Architecture in JJ School of Art. In fact, painting has been my favorite subject since childhood, but I never thought about making a career out of it. I always wanted to put a degree next to my name and after meeting her, I realized that architecture can be a career option. I believe, when we get options we are often confused. Due to our financial situation, we had no option/choice than getting admission in a government college. I prepared well for the exam & got good marks too. In 2017, I got admission in the prestigious Rachna Sansad’s Academy of Architecture, Mumbai. I could be the woman who has fear, who don’t have her opinions, who was quite & shy inside, but I realize my potential to do, to be or to achieve anything that I want & wanted the world would see it. Today, I am not only an Architect; but a Miss India, Model, TEDX Speaker & but being independent & confident has always been my dream! Growing up & transform my life into a meaningful turn is what I learned from depression."
MotivationalStory,Dishi Garg,Panic attacks or depression or anxiety attacks are all curable.,I had my first depression attack when I least expected it. I was getting married to the man I love; I had a perfect job and amazing family. It was such a dark feeling; I felt lost; suffocated and confused. I kept crying for days without any reason.

I was getting married to the man I love, I had a perfect job and amazing family. It was such a dark feeling, I felt lost, suffocated and confused. I kept crying for days without any reason. I had out of body experiences and would sweat profusely. It was only after I met my psychiatrist that I realised I was suffering from depression and I kept thinking 'But Why?!'. I started meds and it took two month for the meds to start working. Those two months were the toughest days of my life. I had constant panic attacks & suicidal thoughts. However, my parents and my doc were my biggest support! I came out of depression because of their love, presence and constant affirmation that I will be fine. Following months I had a perfect wedding and even shifted cities. I gained back my confidence to manage things on my own. I have had a few depression attacks post my first episode, however, it has only made me strong and also understand the triggers. Some changes in my lifestyle such as sleeping on time, having the right kind of food and exercise has helped me a lot. Panic attacks, depression, anxiety attacks are all curable. Please seek assistance if you feel any symptoms. All we need is a good doctor, patience and a supportive family or friend."

I feel begin real is the best gift one can give to themselves. I was patient of depression for more than 2 years, diagnosed with Clinically depression. Depression made my life miserable but after coming out trying my best to reach as many people as I can and got the opportunity to have stimulation in European Parliament to survive 510 European Million people and with the hardworking dedication for the betterment of 28 Members state. As say's Coins always have two sides, depression went away but my health got disturbed, taking medicine is my daily life if I can say, deal with Tuberculosis, Tonsiland lastly dealing with Cancerogenic enzyme H. Pylori, nothing new last month also got IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) in the stomach. I feel being depressed kill people inner mind like, living a life of death living person, that what I felt and now trying my best to remove this big stigma from people's mind, as I lost my own Grandmother because of Depression so I am the person who wishes to put a small drop in the ocean of peoples brain that, Mind warming also we need to talk about as we do for Global warming, So I can't find any story than my own real story to share with people. I want to raise my voice why it so easy to open a cloth or to be naked in front of Dr or Physician for examination but so hard to open a mind in front of at least to a near and dear one. As living in the technology era, we are updating over self with the new things but are we accepting new ideas or emotions of the people or at least a family member. We learned that ""Expression rather than Suppression"" are we expressive and what if we express, are there are people who really care, and ask How are you or it just a formality? Do we really care and mean it? always fine and good, maybe the negating things behind the big story going in the mind. There are so many untold stories going in mind but there is at least one listener who has time and wishes to hold our hand and at least try to listen? Contacted with Facebook or facetime is easy nowadays but it's so hard to contact to someone genuinely on the face. Depression is a big taboo topic, which shouldn't be taboo. I feel it's OKAY to be not OK sometimes. Why people consider Depression as mental sickness to a disease which is curable, Being judge by people is the biggest fear one can have and that what stops our mouth and brain to open. Also, how scientifically it is affecting our mind, so many problems can occur just being alone or silent, make as dark but also the inner body started destroying as we are doing with our emotions."
